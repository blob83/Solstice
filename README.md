## Building
To build Solstice, you will need some **important** dependencies.
### Installing the dependency
First, you need to head to https://www.msys2.org/ and install MSYS2.

------
When selecting your installation folder, make sure you have this path there.

Then simply proceed with the install.<br>
Once it's done installing, you need to find and open **MSYS2 MSYS**.

Once it's open you should see a window like this:

Go in that window, and paste this command:
```pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-binutils``` <br>
Press Y on this prompt:

Then, once that is done, you can close that window.<br>
From there, CMake should automatically locate the dependency it needs, <br>
and your setup for the dependencies are ready!<br>
